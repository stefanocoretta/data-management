# Research compendium

> A **research compendium** accompanies, enhances, or is a scientific publication providing data, code, and documentation for reproducing a scientific workflow.

—[Research Compendium](https://research-compendium.science)

--

> A **research compendium** is a collection of all digital parts of a research project including data, code, texts (protocols, reports, questionnaires, meta data). The collection is created in such a way that reproducing all results is straightforward.

# Organise your files

- Create one folder and make that the folder for your dissertation project.

- In that create folders for `data/` and for `scripts/` (and `plots/`, `dissertation/`, etc).

- In `data/` have a `raw/` and `derived/` folders:

  - Raw data (data that, if lost, it is very unfortunate; for example, experiment data, data which was manually annotated, etc) should be saved in `data/raw/`.
  
  - Derived data (data that is derived with scripts) should be saved in `data/derived/`.

# Backup, backup, BACKUP!

**Make sure you have a backup system in place.**

--

- Saving copies of the entire folder in an external hard drive.

- Saving copies of the entire folder in an online storage service (iCloud Drive, One Drive, DropBox, Google Drive, ...).

- Using a versioning system like [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git).

# Research projects are dyanamic

- Be prepared to change how files and folders are organised after you start.

- Projects evolve over time and sometimes you need to clean things up.

- Use a **good** system to mark versions in your files. Two simple systems:

  - Use full DATE in the file name
    - `dissertation-2022-11-21`.
    - `dissertation-2023-03-01`.
  
  - Use version number
    - Inspired by [Semantic versioning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-semantic-versioning/) from programming but can be helpful with research files too!
    - `dissertation-v1.0`.
    - `dissertation-v1.1`.
    - `dissertation-v2.0`.

# Types of data

- Tabular (or rectangular) data (like spreadsheets).

- Audio and/or video recordings.

- Texts or transcripts.

- Annotation (ELAN, TextGrids, ...).

- Images.

- ...

---

# Tabular data

- Rows and columns.

- Prefer formats like Comma Separated Values (`.csv`) or Tab Separated Values (`.tsv`) over MS Excel.

- If you use Excel, keep one sheet per Excel file! (Don't have data in multiple sheet within the same Excel file).

- Include ONE TABLE per file. (You can transform and summarise data in R).

---

# Coding data

Use **explicit coding**:

- Don't use colours to code your data! (Software like R will discard colours and any formatting).

- Each variable to be coded should have its own column.

- Use clear labels:

  - ACCURACY: incorrect, correct.
    - Not 0, 1.
  - DYSLEXIC: dyslexic, non-dyslexic (or control).
    - Not 0, 1 or yes, no.
  - VOWEL: a, i, u.
  -
